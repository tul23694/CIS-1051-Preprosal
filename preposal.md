# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Molecular clock website that animates a timeline of natural history
Website listing out the next animals to go extinct, how long it will take, and the primary causes
    Kind of like the IUCN Red List
Website that warns about the 6th mass extinction, and giving information about the 5th
Website that goes into Valorant agents and gives the best agent per map
All of these... but in app form?
An app that looks at real-time net production of carbon emissions and real-time contributors towards global climate change

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I am not sure yet

## Do you have any questions of your own?

With my ideas, I will be dealing with a large amount of data. Where do you suggest that I get this data, and how do you think I should work with it? Are there more efficient ways than what we have learned in class?
Am I thinking too ambitiously? I'm not sure if these are possible, but they are certainly just ideas.
